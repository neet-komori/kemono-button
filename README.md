# Kemono Button 2.0

A full rewrite of old Kemono Button.

- New simple and clean UI
- New checking using [Kemono API](https://github.com/mbaharip/kemono-api)
- More stable and faster

## What is Kemono Button?

Kemono Button is a userscript that will add a floating button that will led you to the artist's Kemono page.  
It also gonna check if the artist is already in the database or not.

### Why?

The sole reason is because I'm tired of opening new tab and search for the artist's Kemono page, and find out that the artist page doesn't exist.

## How to install?

You can simply install it by clicking [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neet-komori/kemono-button/main/dist/kemono-button.user.js)  
Or if you paranoid about the content, you can check the source code [here](https://github.com/neet-komori/kemono-button/tree/main/src)

### How to use?

Open any artist page on [supported website](#supported-website),
and you will see a floating button on the bottom left of the page.

Click the button, and it will led you to the artist's Kemono page.
